## DESCRIPTION OF TASK

1. Tools Used

To build this system, a combination of programming language, libraries, and supporting utilities were used:

Java Programming Language:
Java was chosen for its platform independence, object-oriented design, and strong library support. It provides APIs for file handling, user input, and integration with third-party libraries like Mahout.

Apache Mahout Library:
Apache Mahout is a scalable machine learning library designed for recommendation systems, clustering, and classification. In this project, Mahout’s collaborative filtering APIs were used:

FileDataModel: Loads dataset from CSV files.

PearsonCorrelationSimilarity: Computes similarity between users based on their ratings.

NearestNUserNeighborhood: Identifies the closest neighbors to a given user.

GenericUserBasedRecommender: Generates recommendations using collaborative filtering logic.

CSV File (Dataset):
A simple .csv file stores user-item ratings in the format:

userID,itemID,rating


Example: 1,101,5 means User 1 gave Item 101 a rating of 5. This dataset acts as the input for Mahout’s recommendation engine.

Java Compiler and Runtime (JDK):

javac compiles .java source files into .class files.

java executes the compiled bytecode using the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

Command Prompt / Terminal:
Used to compile the code, include Mahout JAR files via the -cp (classpath) option, and run the application.

2. Editor Used

Several editors or IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) can be used to write and test the Java code:

Eclipse IDE: A popular, open-source IDE that simplifies managing JAR dependencies, debugging, and structuring projects.

IntelliJ IDEA: A modern IDE with intelligent refactoring, auto-completion, and strong Maven/Gradle support.

NetBeans IDE: A beginner-friendly IDE often used in academic environments.

Lightweight Editors (Notepad, Notepad++, or VS Code): These can also be used along with command-line compilation.

In most cases, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA are preferred for professional projects because they provide advanced debugging and easy handling of external libraries like Mahout.

3. Platform Used

The platform for this project is the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the underlying operating system.

Java Development Kit (JDK):
The JDK provides the javac compiler, JVM, and core libraries needed for execution. Version 8 or higher is generally recommended for Mahout projects.

Operating System Compatibility:
Since Java is platform-independent, the project can run on Windows, Linux, or macOS without modification.

Networking and Execution Environment:

The project runs locally on the command line.

Input is provided interactively (user ID and number of recommendations), and output is displayed directly in the console.

4. Applications of the Task

The AI-based recommendation system is not just an academic exercise but has numerous real-world applications:

E-commerce Platforms:
Websites like Amazon and Flipkart use recommendation systems to suggest products based on customer purchase history and ratings.

Streaming Services:
Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify rely heavily on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations to suggest movies, videos, or music.

Online Learning Platforms:
Platforms like Coursera or Udemy use recommendation systems to suggest relevant courses to learners based on their interests and prior enrollments.

Retail and Marketing:
Personalized advertisements and promotions are driven by AI-based recommender systems that target users with products most likely to interest them.

Social Media Platforms:
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter use recommendation systems to suggest friends, pages, groups, or trending posts.

Healthcare Applications:
Recommendation systems can be applied to suggest treatment plans, health-related articles, or wellness programs tailored to patient needs.

General Educational Value:
This project gives students and developers hands-on experience with machine learning concepts, collaborative filtering, similarity measures, and practical implementation using Mahout.
